Telling image-based tales of the microbiome

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to contain data, scripts, and results that are relative to a collaborative effort at innovating the application of Neural Network methods to microbiome data.

Currently we have generated a somewhat novel algorithm for the encoding of microbiome data as an image, and we report on it here.
